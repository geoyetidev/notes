### Authority Is Constructed and Contextual
<ul>
Information resources reflect their creatorsâ€™ expertise and credibility, and are evaluated based on the information need and the context in which the information will be used. Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize different types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the level of authority required.
</ul>
Authority is a type of influence,  is that authority earned?
Ask questions about:
+ origins,
+ context
+ suitability for the current information need
+ 
"... novice learners come to respect the expertise that authority represents while remaining skeptical of the systems that have elevated that authority and the information created by it."

#### Information Creation as a Process
<ul>
Information in any format is produced to convey a message and is shared via a selected delivery method. The iterative processes of researching, creating, revising, and disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these differences.
</ul>

We trust AI more because we believe the model has no "intent" to produce a message and is a neutral information broker. Because of this we ascribe more authority to its outputs but really we've obfuscated the source data (both baseline and fine-tuning) in such a way that we can no longer directly address its reliability. 

#### Information Has Value
<ul>
Information possesses several dimensions of value, including as a commodity, as a means of
education, as a means to influence, and as a means of negotiating and understanding the world. Legal and socioeconomic interests influence information production and dissemination.
</ul>

High quality, objective, non-persuasive **free** information is rarely available.

#### Research as Inquiry
<ul>Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly complex or new questions whose answers in turn develop additional questions or lines of inquiry in any field. </ul>
Constructive disagreement refines knowledge

#### Scholarship as Conversation
<ul> Communities of scholars, researchers, or professionals engage in sustained discourse with new insights and discoveries occurring over time as a result of varied perspectives and interpretations</ul>
lack of fluency in the language and process of a discipline disempowers ones ability to participate. 

#### Search as Strategic Exploration
<ul> Searching for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation of a range of information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new understanding develops.</ul>

Resolving an information need is an iterative process that includes "inquiry, discovery and serendipity" Search is a contextualized, complex experience. Having an explicit understanding of when you are "done" searching is key.
