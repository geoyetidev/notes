Paper: [[GLUE- A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding]]

**The goal**: To measure a model's ability to perform a variety of natural language understanding tasks.

**The test**: The model is tested on a suite of language tasks, including sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and sentence similarity.

## Definitions
_Sentiment analysis_ is the process of determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text, typically categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.

_Textual entailment_ is the task of determining whether a given piece of text (the hypothesis) can be inferred or logically follows from another piece of text (the premise).

Here's an example of textual entailment:

	Premise: "The cat is on the mat."
	Hypothesis: "There is a cat."

This is a positive textual entailment because the second sentence (hypothesis) can be inferred from the first sentence (premise).
